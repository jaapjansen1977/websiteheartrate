      <h2 class="display-2 fs-2">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The &ldquo;athlete heartrate tracking application&rdquo; is a tool designed to help users visualize and analyze heart rate data for multiple participants collected through their respective Fitbit devices. By offering clear and intuitive data visualizations, the application enables professionals such as coaches, teachers and researches to better understand the cardiovascular patterns and fitness progress of the individuals in the group."</p>
      <h2 class="display-2 fs-2">Key Features</h2>
      <p>The main feature of the application is to visualize the heart rates of the individuals of a group, constrained to a selected date and a time range.</p>
      <p>Optionally, the user can divide the participants into multiple subgroups in order to group the data in a way that is more consistent with the use case.</p>
      <h2 class="display-2 fs-2">How It Works</h2>
      <p>1. Create a Fitbit account and connect it to a Fitbit device</p>
      <p>2. Approve a request for the heart rate information to be collected by this application</p>
      <p>3. Put the API keys for the account in a file used by the application</p>
      <p>4. Manually add an identifier such as a username for the person, relate it to the Fitbit client ID and optionally assign it to a subgroup in a file used by the application</p>
      <p>5. Run the application and view the progression of the heart rate.</p>
      <h2 class="display-2 fs-2">Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The intended target audience for this applications is professionals such as a coach for a sports team, a teacher, or a researcher, who wish to track the heart rate of their respective participant group.</p>
